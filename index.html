      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>At Friend for a Day, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information, as well as how you can report any inappropriate behavior within the app. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Reporting Concerns</h2>
      <p>We take user safety seriously and have implemented a mechanism for reporting inappropriate behavior. If you encounter a user whose actions or content violate our Privacy Policy or are otherwise concerning, you can report them directly through the app.</p>
      <p>To report a user:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the conversation screen where the user is present.</li>
        <li>Tap the menu button located at the top right of the conversation screen.</li>
        <li>Select “Report User” from the options.</li>
        <li>This will immediately exit you from the chat and place a report in our system for manual review.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once a report is submitted, our team will manually review the situation. If we determine that the reported user has violated our Privacy Policy or engaged in inappropriate behavior, the user will be banned from using the app.</p>
    </section>

      <ul>
        <li>Review the content of the conversation and any other relevant context.</li>
        <li>Investigate the user's activity within the app.</li>
        <li>Take action in accordance with our policies, which may include banning the user if they have violated the app's rules or engaged in harmful behavior.</li>
      </ul>
